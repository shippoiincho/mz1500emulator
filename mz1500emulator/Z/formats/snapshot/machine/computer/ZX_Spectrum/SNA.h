|  This format is one of the most well-supported of all snapshot formats       |
|  (for the ZX Spectrum), but has a drawback:				       |
|									       |
|  As the program counter is pushed onto the stack so that a RETN	       |
|  instruction can restart the program, 2 bytes of memory are overwritten.     |
|  This will usually not matter; the game (or whatever) will have stack space  |
|  that can be used for this. However, if this space is all in use when the    |
|  snap is made, memory below the stack space will be corrupted. According to  |
|  Rui Ribeiro, the effects of this can sometimes be avoided by replacing the  |
|  corrupted bytes with zeros; e.g. take the PC from the, stack pointer,       |
|  replace that word with 0000h and then increment SP. This worked with	       |
|  snapshots of Batman, Bounder and others which had been saved at critical    |
|  points. Theoretically, this problem could cause a complete crash on a real  |
|  Spectrum if the stack pointer happened to be at address 4000h; the push     |
|  would try and write to the ROM.					       |
|									       |
|  When the registers have been loaded, a RETN command is required to start    |
|  the program. IFF2 is short for interrupt flip-flop 2, and for all	       |
|  practical purposes is the interrupt-enabled flag. Set means enabled.        |

|    Author: McGavin, Peter <p.mcgavin@irl.cri.nz>			       |
|  Supports: ZX Spectrum + 128K						       |

|  The 128K version of the SNA format is the same as above, with extensions    |
|  to include the extra memory banks of the 128K/+2 machines, and fixes the    |
|  problem with the PC being pushed onto the stack - now it is located in an   |
|  extra variable in the file (and is not pushed onto the stack at all). The   |
|  first 49179 bytes of the snapshot are otherwise exactly as described        |
|  above.								       |
|									       |
|  The third RAM bank saved is always the one currently paged, even if this    |
|  is page 5 or 2 - in this case, the bank is actually included twice. The     |
|  remaining RAM banks are saved in ascending order - e.g. if RAM bank 4 is    |
|  paged in, the snapshot is made up of banks 5, 2 and 4 to start with, and    |
|  banks 0, 1, 3, 6 and 7 afterwards. If RAM bank 5 is paged in, the snapshot  |
|  is made up of banks 5, 2 and 5 again, followed by banks 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 and   |
|  7.									       |
